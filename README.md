# **Assignment 1 and Activity 2: Python OOP Challenges**

This project demonstrates the power of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python through two engaging activities: designing a custom class and exploring polymorphism.  

---

## **Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! üèóÔ∏è**

The first part of the assignment focuses on creating a custom class. This class can represent any real-world object or concept, such as a **Smartphone**, **Book**, or even a **Superhero**. Here's what this activity includes:

### **Features**:

1. **Custom Class Creation**  
   - Design a Python class representing your chosen object.
   - Add relevant **attributes** and **methods** to bring the class to life.

2. **Object Initialization**  
   - Use a **constructor** (`__init__`) to initialize each object with unique values, ensuring every instance of the class has distinct characteristics.

3. **Inheritance and Encapsulation**  
   - Implement an inheritance layer to extend functionality.
   - Explore encapsulation by making some attributes or methods private and controlling access through getter and setter methods.

---

## **Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! üé≠**

This activity showcases **polymorphism** in Python by creating multiple classes with a shared method but distinct implementations. The program revolves around animals or vehicles, where each class defines the `move()` method differently.

### **Example**:
- **Car**: Implements `move()` to print `"Driving üöó"`.
- **Plane**: Implements `move()` to print `"Flying ‚úàÔ∏è"`.
- **Boat**: Implements `move()` to print `"Sailing üö§"`.

## **Learning Objectives**

Through this project, you will:
1. Understand and implement core **OOP concepts**:  
   - **Classes and Objects**  
   - **Constructors**  
   - **Inheritance**  
   - **Encapsulation**
   - **Polymorphism**

2. Practice designing flexible and reusable code structures in Python.

3. Gain hands-on experience with **dynamic method overriding** to showcase polymorphism.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### **Running the Program**

1. Clone the repository or download the `.py` file.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python assignment.py
   ```

---

## **Project Structure**

- **Assignment 1**: Contains the main class and its child classes showcasing inheritance and encapsulation.  
- **Activity 2**: Demonstrates polymorphism through classes with the same method (`move()`) but different behaviors.

---

## **Example Output**

### **Assignment 1 Output:**
```python
# Example class: Superhero
Superhero Name: Spider-Man
Power: Web-Shooting
Mission: Protecting New York
```

### **Activity 2 Output:**
```python
# Vehicles with polymorphic behavior
Car: Driving üöó
Plane: Flying ‚úàÔ∏è
Boat: Sailing üö§
```

## **Customization**

Feel free to:
- Add more attributes or methods to the classes.
- Create additional subclasses to expand functionality.
- Modify the `move()` method in Activity 2 to include new actions for different objects.
